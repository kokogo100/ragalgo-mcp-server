## 1. Executive Summary

In 2025, AI technology has evolved into a fusion of **LLM (Reasoning)** and **RAG (Retrieval)**. However, legacy RAG systems face a critical limitation: they remain stuck in the role of a **'Library'**, merely retrieving text fragments.

**RagAlgo** transcends this limitation by proposing a **'Hippocampus'** architecture that reconstructs financial market data through **Causality** and **Sentiment**.

We call this technology **SDT (Semantic Digital Twin)**. RagAlgo is not just a search engine; it is a **Long-term Contextual Memory** that replicates the complex financial market into semantic units, enabling AI to 'feel' the market atmosphere and 'remember' the context.

## 2. Core Philosophy: The Hippocampus Architecture

The decisive difference between Legacy RAG and RagAlgo lies in the **'Method of Memory'**.

### 2.1 Dictionary vs Hippocampus
*   **Legacy RAG (Dictionary)**: When you search for "Samsung Electronics", it fetches documents containing the word. (Simple Search)
*   **RagAlgo (Hippocampus)**: When you call "Samsung Electronics", it retrieves the **connected Sentiments, Related Events, and Recent Trends** as a single context. (Associative Recall)

RagAlgo is inspired by the human brain's principle of tagging memories not just with **'Facts'** but also with **'Emotions'**. This is the key key to helping AI understand the **'Fear & Greed'** of the financial market.

## 3. Key Technology: SDT Framework

RagAlgo's SDT framework consists of three core modules, powered by the **CKN (Contextual Knowledge Network)** architecture. *(Detailed architecture is available in the [Technical Report](./RagAlgo_Technical_Report_Architecture.md))*

### 3.1 Self-Growing Taxonomy (Data Flywheel)
The financial market is a living organism where new terms (e.g., Meme Coins, New Themes) are born daily.
*   **Static DB**: Manual entry cannot keep up with market speed.
*   **Evolutionary DB**: Given an initial Seed Tag, RagAlgo **automatically learns related terms and expands its classification system** through incoming news.
*   **Business Value**: This creates a **'Data Flywheel'** effect where the knowledge base becomes exponentially more sophisticated the longer the system operates.

### 3.2 The Sentiment Amygdala
RagAlgo assigns a **Quantified Sentiment Score** to all financial information.
*   Beyond simple "Good/Bad", it quantifies the impact shock (-10 ~ +10).
*   This data becomes a unique dataset for learning **"How did the news look when prices went up?"** by combining it with Asset Price.

### 3.3 Temporal Cortex
Market memories are stored in time-series **Snapshots**.
*   "Samsung Electronics" yesterday is different from "Samsung Electronics" today.
*   RagAlgo **freezes and stores the 'Market Atmosphere'** of every moment. This allows AI to Recall "how the market reacted during similar past patterns."

## 4. The Value Proposition

RagAlgo is not just software; it is a factory producing **'Irreplaceable Data'**.

### 4.1 For AI Services (B2B)
*   Generic LLMs do not know the stock market. With RagAlgo, generic AIs like GPT/Claude instantly gain the memory of a **'Veteran Financial Expert'**.
*   **Killer Feature**: Answers abstract questions like "How is the market atmosphere right now?" in **1 second** by summarizing real-time sentiment scores of 3,000 assets.

### 4.2 For Quant Trading (Data Sales)
*   Price and Volume data are a commodity.
*   However, **"Time-Series Data of Context and Sentiment"** is a source of **Alpha** that only RagAlgo can provide.

## 5. Vision: From Market to World

Our starting point is **Finance**. Finance is the **'Ultimate Testbed'**, possessing the most data, changing the fastest, and requiring the most accurate judgments.

RagAlgo's **SDT (Semantic Digital Twin)** technology is ready to expand beyond finance into Politics, Society, Trend Analysis, and any domain where **'Context and Flow'** matter.

> **RagAlgo - We digitize the context.**
